We spent an entire day wandering the peaceful streets of Buda — more specifically, Újbuda.\n\nThe listener gently drifts through the emotional landscape inspired by this new home — just like the artist himself. We follow him through a calm, laid-back day as he explores the neighborhood, reflects in silence, and moves forward with a deep sense of gratitude for the path that brought him here.",

Once again, we return to his hometown, where the snowy landscape, his old school, and familiar surroundings set the tone.\n\nThrough his childlike self, Kain highlights the importance of family.

I thrive on solving problems through clean, well-structured code and intuitive user interfaces. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a range of projects—from large-scale platforms to lean startup environments—often taking ownership of the entire development process.\n\nIn addition to coding, I have a deep passion for visual storytelling. I shoot and edit music videos, short films, and other creative video content, and I’m also experienced in photography. I enjoy bringing ideas to life—whether it's through code, camera, or a blend of both.",
