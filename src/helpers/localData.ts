We spent an entire day wandering the peaceful streets of Buda — more specifically, Újbuda.\n\nThe listener gently drifts through the emotional landscape inspired by this new home — just like the artist himself. We follow him through a calm, laid-back day as he explores the neighborhood, reflects in silence, and moves forward with a deep sense of gratitude for the path that brought him here.",

Its imagery reflects the night and emotional state in which the song was written.\n\nKain speaks to a more mystical presence, singing about longing for them. At the same time, he highlights the presence of teenage depression and gently invites the listener to accept the feeling of being lost in the uncertainty of their own thoughts",

Once again, we return to his hometown, where the snowy landscape, his old school, and familiar surroundings set the tone.\n\nThrough his childlike self, Kain highlights the importance of family. Old memories resurface, emotional voids quietly emerge, and through the many versions of his past self, he expresses a deep sense of gratitude — one that has shaped the person he is today.",

I thrive on solving problems through clean, well-structured code and intuitive user interfaces. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a range of projects—from large-scale platforms to lean startup environments—often taking ownership of the entire development process.\n\nIn addition to coding, I have a deep passion for visual storytelling. I shoot and edit music videos, short films, and other creative video content, and I’m also experienced in photography. I enjoy bringing ideas to life—whether it's through code, camera, or a blend of both.",
